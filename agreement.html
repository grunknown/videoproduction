                        <ol>
                          <li class="agreement__list-item">For the revenue share payment models, the commission is calculated based on one of the two remuneration offers chosen during the account registration: “50% of profit for all traders” or “40% of profit for each trader separately”. For the “50% of profit for all traders” offer, the commission is calculated as described in p. 5.2. For the “40% of profit for each trader separately” offer, the commission is calculated and credited to the Affiliate’s balance as follows:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- After the deal is closed: 2.5% of the deal’s volume;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- At the end of each day: the difference between 40% of the broker’s profit from the deals made by each attracted trader during the day and the commission already credited for such deals.<br>The commission is payable only for the deals executed by the clients attracted by the Affiliate and profitable to the broker, and may not exceed 40% of the total amount of net deposits of each client. This applies to affiliates registered on April 10, 2019, and later.</li>
                          <li class="agreement__list-item">For affiliates registered before September 3, 2018, the commission is calculated and credited to the Affiliate’s balance as follows:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- After the deal is closed: 2.5% of the deal’s volume;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- At the end of each day: the difference between 50% of the broker’s profit from all the deals made by all attracted traders during the day and the commission already credited for such deals.<br>The commission is payable only for the deals executed by the clients attracted by the Affiliate and profitable to the broker, and may not exceed 50% of the total amount of net deposits of clients.</li>
                          <li class="agreement__list-item">For affiliates registered from September 3, 2018, to April 09, 2019, the commission is calculated depending on the period passed since a trader registered an account so that the total revenue share percentage equals to: for the first month since the account registration - 70%, for the second month - 57%, for the third month - 50%, for the fourth month - 35%, for the fifth month - 20%, for the sixth and all subsequent months - 15%. In a case of inactivity which is defined by having less than 7 registrations and less than 4 FTDs for the last three months, the revenue share percentage is changed to the following: for the first month since the account registration - 70%, for the second month - 57%, for the third month - 45%, for the fourth month - 30%, for the fifth month - 15%, for the sixth to twelfth months - 10%, for all subsequent months - 5%.</li>
                          <li class="agreement__list-item">Notwithstanding the above, the Affiliates registered before September 3, 2018, and the Affiliates registered on April 10, 2019, and later who have chosen the “50% of profit for all traders” offer are subject to Standard and Advanced calculation rates. The Standard rate is the calculation rate described in p. 5.2. The Advanced rate is applied to the Affiliate account in a case of reaching 21 FTDs (first-time depositors) over a period of the last 30 days and changes the commission calculated and credited to the Affiliate’s balance for the traders attracted during the period Advanced rate is active to the following:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- After the deal is closed: 2.5% of the deal’s volume;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- At the end of each day: the difference between 50% of the broker’s profit from the deals made by each attracted trader during the day and the commission already credited for such deals.<br>The Advanced rate eligibility check is performed daily for each Affiliate account. The Advanced rate applies to the Affiliate account for a period of 30 days and extends for every consecutive 30 days should the conditions of obtaining it continue to be met. Should the Affiliate fail to meet the conditions of obtaining the Advanced rate, the Affiliate account is switched back to the Standard rate until such conditions are met once again. The commission for traders attracted during the period Advanced Rate was active is calculated in accordance with the Advanced rate regardless of the current Affiliate’s calculation rate.</li>
                          <li class="agreement__list-item">For the CPA payment model, the commission is calculated for each attracted Unique Active Trader (as defined below) based on the Unique Active Trader’s country of residence, type of the registration device, and/or other criteria in accordance with the Affiliate’s Price Set&nbsp;<a href="https://admin-new.affiliate.8xtrade.com/statistics-cpa/price-set" target="_blank">specified in the affiliate cabinet</a>. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may amend the Price Set at any time at its sole and absolute discretion. Such amendments shall have an immediate effect, shall not require the previous consent of the Affiliate, and the Affiliate shall be responsible to keep himself informed at all times for these amendments.

                              <li class="agreement__list-item">All statements must be balanced; therefore if you mention potential profits you must always also mention potential losses. When promoting 8xtrade, do not promise that one can learn trading easily or profitably with 8xtrade unless you are specifically referring to the demo account.
