                    <ul>
                      <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”).</li>

In such a case, your data will be stored but not processed until the expiration of the retention obligation.</li>
                      <li>Subject to the legal basis on which the processing activity is based, you may object to the processing of your personal data. Please note that in some cases, we may have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which we need to comply with.</li>
                      <li>Request restriction of the processing of your personal data (a) if it is not accurate;(b) where processing may be unlawful but you do not want us to erase your data; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it; or (d) where you may have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
